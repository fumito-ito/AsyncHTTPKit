/// Base protocol for session types.
///
/// This protocol serves as a marker interface for session-related types
/// in the AsyncHTTPKit architecture. It provides a common base for
/// different session implementations across platforms.
///
/// Currently, this protocol has no requirements, allowing for maximum
/// flexibility in session implementation while maintaining type safety.
